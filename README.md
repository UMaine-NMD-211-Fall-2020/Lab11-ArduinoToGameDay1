# Lab11: Arduino To Game Day 1
Welcome to the first remote lab of 2020. 
During this lab, we will work towards using your Arduino sensors in your final project game. 
**This is not a lab to submit**, just suggested steps to take to understand how to implement Arduino with your game. 

## Structure of Lab Session
1. Discussion of each person's project & proposed choice of sensor. Why is your sensor appropriate for your project?
2. Break into groups around each sensor. Solo work with group support. 
3. Back to group. Discuss what learned, what still need to do. If you made progress, share it. 

## Suggested Work during solo time
Here are some suggested tasks and focus questions for you to focus on during the solo work portion of the lab
- What sensor(s) are you using with your game? Why?
- What output does this sensor give over the serial port? If this sensor gives multiple types of data, how do you extract the data you want, and nothing else?
- How do you interpret this data?
- What steps do you need to take to send this data to processing?
- Work towards sending this data to processing. Use the data to control the motion of a simple shape. 
- Refine data input / manipulation in processing
- Integrate it into your game. Refine Further. 
- (If you get to it today - great! If not, there's next week) User testing via your group mates
 
### Recommended Prior Work
#### Learn to use your sensor
If you did not finish the tutorial where you learn to the relevant sensors, do the relevant input / output lab. The sensors are explained via tutorials in Lab 8 and Lab 9, as well as in various tutorials and the DVD that came with your kit. 

#### Learn to manipulate Serial Data
If you did not finish [Lab 10](https://github.com/UMaine-NMD-211-Fall-2020/Lab10-ArduinoToProcessing), which was where we learned how to use the serial port and connect Processing with Arduino, I recommend working on that lab first. 

## Documentation
I recommend documenting everything. Take photos/video of the steps, answer the questions, if you ran into problems, document them & approaches you took to solving them.  While I am not checking this lab, feel free to make a folder to record your work / make a pull request. Mike may want to see some of this as part of your final project submission, but that's something you may want to check. It will help you if you forget what you did, run into problems somewhere in the process, or need to show your process in the future. 

If you plan on documenting what you did in lab today via Github, please link to what is relevant to today below.
