# Lab11: Arduino To Game Day 1
Welcome to the first remote lab of 2020. 
During this lab, we will work towards using your Arduino sensors in your final project game. 
**This is not a lab to submit**, just suggested steps to take to understand how to implement Arduino with your game. 

## Structure of Lab Session
0. Review Deadlines, Requirements, Etc. 
1. Discussion of each person's project & proposed choice of sensor. Why is your sensor appropriate for your project?
2. Break into groups around each sensor. Solo work with group support. 
3. Back to group. Discuss what learned, what still need to do. If you made progress, share it. 

## Suggested Work during solo time
Here are some suggested tasks and focus questions for you to focus on during the solo work portion of the lab
- What sensor(s) are you using with your game? Why?
- What output does this sensor give over the serial port? If this sensor gives multiple types of data, how do you extract the data you want, and nothing else? Serial print your data.
- How do you interpret this data?
- What steps do you need to take to send this data to processing?
- Work towards sending this data to processing. Use the data to control the motion of a simple shape. 
- Refine data input / manipulation in processing
- Integrate it into your game. Refine Further. 
- (If you get to it today - great! If not, there's next week) User testing via your group mates
 
### Recommended Prior Work
#### Learn to use your sensor
If you did not finish the tutorial where you learn to the relevant sensors, do the relevant input / output lab. Similarly, if you are using a different sensor than you used in Lab 8 or 9, learn to use your sensor first. Learning to use your sensor should be your first step.

The sensors are explained via tutorials in [Lab 8](https://github.com/UMaine-NMD-211-Fall-2020/Lab8-GeneralInputSensors) and [Lab 9](https://github.com/UMaine-NMD-211-Fall-2020/Lab9-OutputSensors), as well as in various other online tutorials and the via DVD that came with your kit. 

#### Learn to manipulate Serial Data
If you did not finish [Lab 10](https://github.com/UMaine-NMD-211-Fall-2020/Lab10-ArduinoToProcessing), which was where we learned how to use the serial port and connect Processing with Arduino, do this after you learn to use your sensor. 

## Documentation
I recommend documenting everything. Take photos/video of the steps, answer the questions, if you ran into problems, document them & approaches you took to solving them. Make sketches as needed, draw diagrams, take pictures. While I am not checking this lab, feel free to make a folder to record your work in the google drive to save it or make a pull request. Since this is not required, if you have a prefered method of documenting work, feel free to do that (say, a notebook/sketchbook/etc.) I do not know if any of this will be required for your final submission. Even if it is not required, it will help you if you forget what you did, run into problems somewhere in the process, or need to show your process in the future. 

If you plan on documenting what you did in lab today via Github, please link to what is relevant to today below.
